It's a great opportunity to actually learn the RoR with all pitfalls and great things.
The course shows how RoR apps are created, from basic to more advanced ones.

The downside is the length of the lecture and no critic about written code - in my opinion, it's not production-ready.

Overall is a great way to write a **LOT** of code and learn RoR from total newbie to regular level ;)
